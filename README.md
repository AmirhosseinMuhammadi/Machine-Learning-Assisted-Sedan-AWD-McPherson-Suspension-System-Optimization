This repository presents a comprehensive study on the optimization of McPherson suspension kinematics using machine learning and gradient- based methods.
The project begins with full-vehicle dynamics simulations, including Single Lane Change and J-Turn maneuvers, to evaluate handling characteristics such as lateral velocity, roll angle, yaw rate, and side slip angle.
Key findings highlight the significant role of the anti-roll bar in maintaining vehicle stability.
The second phase focuses on optimizing the front McPherson suspension geometry through sensitivity analysis and Design of Experiments (DOE), identifying critical hard-points affecting camber, toe, and track width.
A neural network model is trained to predict suspension behavior, and the L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm is employed to minimize deviations from target performance curves.
The optimized design demonstrates improved camber gain, reduced understeer gradient, and enhanced track width stability, aligning closely with ideal kinematic behavior.
